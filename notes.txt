Prepping Program notes and descriptions:

User is an Employee
Employees are categorized as General Manager, Manager, Trainer, Associate, or Baker
All users clock in to log in
When user clocks in, the clock in time is recorded
When user clocks in their permissions are determined
General Managers and Managers have managerial permissions, Trainers, Associates, and Bakers do not
If user is a manager, they have permission to access to the manager menu
The manager menu would normally have many functions that only the managers and general manager can access
For this program the manager menu will mostly consist of adding to inventory and other database editing functions as needed by the Program
If the user is not a manager, the program will assume that the employee is a prepper
Before the prepper can initiate the prepping process, the program will tell the prepper which ingredients and prepped items have expired
The prepper will remove any expired items and the program will update the database accordingly
The prepper will then be able to initiate the prepping process
The program will tell the prepper how many of each prepped item should still be available and will ask for a count from the prepper to confirm
The program will then calculate how many of each item needs to be prepped for that day
The program will then allow the prepper to select an item to begin prepping and the prepper will initiate the item prep sequence
The program will list the ingredients needed for the prepped item and the amounts needed and (possibly) give a description of how the prepper should prep the Ingredients
When the prepper starts prepping each item, the ingredients will be removed from the database as they are "used" and will be "used" in order of nearest expiration date
The prepper will tell the program when the item is finished being prepped
The program will then record the time finished to calculate expiration Date
The program will then update the database to add the item in the inventory and record its appropriate location
When the prepper has finished prepping all items the program will ask to confirm a count of all prepped items in inventory and confirm locations and expiration dates
The program will then initiate the thaw cart sequence
The thaw cart sequence will ask the prepper to confirm counts of all items thawing and inform user of expired items
The program will then tell the user how many of each item needs to be pulled from the freezer to be thawed
The prepper will pull the items from freezer and tell the program how many have been pulled
The program will update the inventory accordingly and record the time to calculate the new expiration dates
The prepper is now done prepping and can clock Out, the clock out time is recorded
When new inventory arrives at the store, the managers or general manager will have a function in the manager menu to take inventory to confirm/update current items and add new items
Managers can also adjust the amounts of prepped items that are needed for each day with another function in the manager menu
